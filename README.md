# fortune-teller
In this project, we will be working with variables and concatenating multiple variables to formulate a string. 

## Prerequisites
In order to complete this project students must have the following:
  - Basic understanding of Github forking and cloning
  - Understanding of declaring and assigning variables
  - Understand how to link HTML with the JS file
  - Basic understanding of the DOM

## Requirements
To complete this project you will need the following:
  - Shell to use the command line
  - Google Chrome browser
  - Sublime Text

## Your Challenge
1. Create and link HTML file `index.html` and a Javascript file `app.js`.
2. In your `index.html`, create `<h1></h1>` tag and add ID attribute of `fortune`.
2. In your `app.js`, assign a value to the following variables: 
    - number of children
    - partner's name 
    - geographic location 
    - job title
3. Output your fortune using the DOM with "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."


## Stretch Goals
### Create Fortune Age Calculator
- Store your birth year in a variable.
- Store a future year in a variable.
- Calculate your 2 possible ages for that year based on the stored values.
- For example, if you were born in 1988, then in 2026 you'll be either 37 or 38, depending on what month it is in 2026. Output them to the screen like so: "I will be either NN or NN in YYYY", substituting the values.
