# Best Pizza Story Ever
In this project, we will be working with variables and concatenating multiple variables to formulate a string.

## Prerequisites
In order to complete this project students must have the following:
  - Basic understanding of Github forking and cloning
  - Understanding of declaring and assigning variables
  - Understand how to link HTML with the JS file
  - Basic understanding of the DOM

## Requirements
To complete this project you will need the following:
  - Shell to use the command line
  - Google Chrome browser
  - Sublime Text

## Your Challenge
1. Create HTML file `index.html` and link to a Javascript file `app.js`.
2. In your `index.html`, under the opening `<body>` tag, create `<h1></h1>` tags with the content **Best Pizza Story Ever**, and add an ID attribute of `title`.
3. Below the `<h1></h1>` that you just created, add `<p></p>` tags, with no content, and add an ID attribute of `result`
4. In your `app.js`, assign a value to EACH the following variables:
    - adjective
    - name
    - noun
    - shape
    - favorite sauce
    - favorite topping
    - kitchen applicance
    - number
    - food
    - day of the week

5. Create a new variable called myStory and assign it to the paragraph below. Plug in your variables in the appropriate areas.

```
Pizza was invented by a {ADJECTIVE} chef named {NAME}.
To make pizza, you need to take a lump of {NOUN}. You mold it into a {SHAPE}.
Then you add {FAVORITE SAUCE} with a handful of {FAVORITE TOPPING}.
Next you have to bake it in a very hot {KITCHEN APPLIANCE}. When it is done, cut it
into {NUMBER} slices. My favorite is {FOOD} pizza. If I could, I would eat it every {DAY OF THE WEEK}.
```

6. Get the element with the ID of `result` from your HTML page, then assign it the myStory variable. Your story should now display on your HTML page.

Note:
  Google `noun` and/or `adjective` if you forgot what they are.

## Stretch Goals

- Link CSS Page to HTML Page
- Format the title and story so it looks cleaner
